# CS-300

A.What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Q.The base problem in this project was to take a csv file and develop code to output the data in alphanumeric order. THe goal here is to pick the right data stucture and the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem in the best way possible. 

A.How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Q.I approached the problem by looking at a few different data structures and doing an indepth runtime analysis on them. Using the right data struture is very important as it has a vast impact on how efficient your code runs.

A.How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Q.Most of the roadblocks that I came across were solved by additional research and study. Increasing ones knowledge on relevent topics is vital to having an accurate analysis.

A.How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Q.This project used a lot of pseudocode and whiteboarding. I definitely understand the importance pre-coding design after this project. Writing psuedocode for the alorithms used in this project has given me skills that I will carry with me and 
  will continue to develop into the future.

A.How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Q.I have a newly developed level of apprication for documentation. Towards the end of the project, I was writing comments on nearly every line of code to help keep it all organized and in order.
